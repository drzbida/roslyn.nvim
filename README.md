# roslyn.nvim

This plugin adds support for the new Roslyn-based C# language server [introduced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code) in the [VS Code C# extension](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp).

Requires at least Neovim 0.10

## Setup

### Install the Roslyn Language Server

1. Navigate to https://dev.azure.com/azure-public/vside/_artifacts/feed/vs-impl to see the latest package feed for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer`
2. Locate the version matching your OS + Arch and click to open it. For example, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.linux-x64` matches Linux-based OS in x64 architecture. Note that some OS/Arch specific packages may have an extra version ahead of the "core" non specific package.
3. On the package page, click the "Download" button to begin downloading its `.nupkg`
   a. (Note, if you need to get a copyable link for the download you can obtain it on chrome by then opening the downloads page, right clicking the file just downloaded, and hitting "copy link address"
4. `.nupkg` files are basically zip archives. In the case of Linux, you can use `unzip` on the downloaded file to unpack it.
5. Copy the contents of `<zip root>/content/LanguageServer/<yourArch/` to `~/.local/share/nvim/roslyn`
   a. if you did it right, the file `~/.local/share/nvim/roslyn/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll` should exist now (along with many other .dlls and etc in that dir).
   You can also specify a custom path to it in the setup function.
6. To test it is working, `cd` into the aforementioned roslyn directory and invoke `dotnet Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll --version`. It should output server's version.

### Install the Plugin

Install `seblj/roslyn.nvim` using your plugin manager.

Example:

```lua
require("roslyn").setup({
    config = {
        -- Here you can pass in any options that that you would like to pass to `vim.lsp.start`
        -- The only options that I explicitly override are, which means won't have any effect of setting here are:
        --     - `name`
        --     - `cmd`
        --     - `root_dir`
        --     - `on_init`
    },
    exe = {
        "dotnet",
        vim.fs.joinpath(vim.fn.stdpath("data"), "roslyn", "Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll"),
    },
    -- NOTE: Set `filewatching` to false if you experience performance problems.
    -- Defaults to true, since turning it off is a hack.
    -- If you notice that the server is _super_ slow, it is probably because of file watching
    -- I noticed that neovim became super unresponsive on some large codebases, and that was because
    -- it schedules the file watching on the event loop.
    -- This issue went away by disabling that capability. However, roslyn will fallback to its own
    -- file watching, which can make the server super slow to initialize.
    -- Setting this option to false will indicate to the server that neovim will do the file watching.
    -- However, in `hacks.lua` I will also just don't start off any watchers, which seems to make the server
    -- a lot faster to initialize.
    filewatching = true,
    offset_encoding = nil, -- add your preferred client offset_encoding here since on_init is overwritten
})
```

### Settings

Settings can be passed to the setup function. The following settings are available [vscode-csharp unit tests link](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/blob/main/test/unitTests/configurationMiddleware.test.ts):

## Usage

If you have multiple solutions, this plugin tries to guess which one to use. If it doesn't manage to guess, or that it is wrong, you can change the target with `:CSTarget` command

## Features

Please note that some features from the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp) might not be supported by this plugin.
